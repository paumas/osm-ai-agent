# Editing OpenStreetMap

## What tools can I use to edit OSM?
Popular editing tools include:
- **iD editor:** A web-based editor, great for beginners.
- **JOSM (Java OpenStreetMap Editor):** A more powerful desktop application for advanced users.
- **StreetComplete:** An Android app for making simple improvements on the go.
- **Vespucci:** A full-featured editor for Android.

## What are tags in OSM?
Tags are key-value pairs used to describe map features. For example, `highway=residential` describes a residential road, and `name=Main Street` gives it a name. Understanding tags is crucial for effective mapping.

## Should I map temporary features?
Generally, OpenStreetMap focuses on features that are relatively permanent. Temporary events or very short-lived features are usually not mapped, though there can be exceptions or specific tagging for them.
